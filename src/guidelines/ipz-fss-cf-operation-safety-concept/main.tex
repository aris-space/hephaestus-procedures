\section{Scope}

Within the framework of the ETH Focus Project HEPHAESTUS, fuel supply system (FSS) cold flows will be performed on the IPZ area. The purpose of a cold flow is to inject the propellants (seperately) without ignition, to check if the propellant supply system functions correctly under operating circumstances.  
\noindent
For the FSS cold flow only \textbf{distilled water} will be used. To ensure efficient and safe tests, this operational safety concept shall describe the test area and its available safety equipment and gives instructions on how to behave during procedures and in emergencies.

\section{Location of safety-relevant Institutions}
The contact information of the relevant safety institutions is listed in \ref{tab:safety-relevant-institutions}.

\section{Risk Analysis}
Water Coldflows involve pressurized systems and therefore have an inherent risk. Since the tests are performed with inert gas (nitrogen) and distilled water, the risks are limited to overpressures and asphyxiation by nitrogen rich atmosphere. These risks and their mitigations are discussed in this section.
\subsection{Overpressure}
An overpressure of the system can lead to rupture of components and therefore to an explosion. Overpressure can cause injury to personnel, namely hearing damage, lung damage and even death, and damage to surrounding facilities. However, during water coldflows, the pressure is limited to 60 bar and all components of the system have previously been tested to 60 bar. Additional preventive measures are taken to minimise the damage caused by a possible overpressure event:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system is equipped with multiple pressure relief valves, which are set to open at 60 bar. This ensures that the pressure in the system is limited to 60 bar, even in the case a pressure reducer were to fail.
    \item The TNT equivalent of the potential energy stored in the system and the size of the corresponding safety radius were calculated according to the ASME PCC-2-2018 standard. The safety radius was determined to be 5 meters. To have an additional safety margin and because it's easier to tape off the quadratic test area, the entire test area, which has a radius of around 20 meters, is taped off and monitored during testing.
    \item The system is equipped with multiple pressure sensors which are monitored continuously during testing. If the pressure exceeds the set limit, an automatic abort is triggered which immediately depressurizes the system.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Asphyxiation}
Asphyxiation can occur if there is a leak of nitrogen gas into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is an inert gas and therefore does not cause any immediate harm to the human body. However, nitrogen displaces oxygen from the air and can therefore lead to asphyxiation. This risk is mitigated by performing the tests outdoors, where the nitrogen can disperse into the atmosphere and does not accumulate.

\section{Site Map}
The tests will be performed in the IPZ Test Area 2. The trailer will be positioned all the way at the fence to the airfield, with both the side of the system that will be pressurized and the engine compartment facing the airfield. The control station will be positioned close to the Hangar. The whole testing area will be taped off to prevent accidental trespassing and during pressurized operations a dedicated person will monitor the area to look out for trespassers.
Figure \ref{fig:location-plan} shows the setup of the test location and the location of the fire extinguisher and first aid kit. During active testing, only the test conductor, safety officer and engineer in charge are allowed inside the taped zone with appropriate safety equipment (safety goggles and ear protection). When the system is pressurized, no one is allowed inside the taped off safety zone.

\section{Equipment}
Every person has to wear a warning vest according to their role at all times during testing operations. The color code displayed in table \ref{tab:color-code} is used.
\begin{table}[h]
    \caption{Warning Vest Color Code}
    \label{tab:color-code}
    \begin{tabularx}{0.9\textwidth}{|X|X|X|X|}

    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}
The safety equipment is stored inside the ARIS Hangar. The wearing of provided safety equipmentas foreseen in the operating procedures is mandatory.

\end{table}
\section{Behaviour during test procedure}
The test conductor has the lead during the whole test operation and therefore gives the orders, which shall be obeyed. The safety officer supervises the actions of the test conductor and the team and makes sure that the tests are executed according to the procedures. The safety officer can stop the operations at any time he considers proceeding with the test as dangerous. \\
\noindent
If during the test procedure an anomaly occurs or if there is an insecurity, the test participants are requested to inform the test conductor and the safety officer immediately.
\newpage
\section{Behaviour in case of an emergency} \label{emergency-behaviour}
In case of an emergency or an unexpected system state, the contingency procedures (shown in table \ref{tab:contingency-procedures}) must be followed. Participants will be informed about the location of the contingency procedures during the briefing and installation.

\end{table}
All attendees are guided to stay calm and to avoid panicking. In such a situation, communication needs to be reduced to the minimum / essential only. The safety officer or his substitute leads through all emergency situations supported by the test conductor. \\
\noindent
In any situation, the hazards must be considered before providing assistance.
\noindent
As soon as the situation allows it, the safety officer will inform IPZ and Chloé Pilloud (ARIS).
