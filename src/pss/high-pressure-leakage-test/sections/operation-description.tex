% Operation description
TThe goal of the high pressure leakage test is to verify that the FSS and OSS main and pressurization systems can withstand their operating pressure without leaking (within defined leakage range). The test is conducted once for 15 minutes (if the system is newly assembled) and then for 5 minutes before every test.
