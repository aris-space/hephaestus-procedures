  \procedureItem{DACS1}{Check the power supply in the HUT and try to restart the system by manually disconnecting it from the mains and reconnecting it.
(A successful connection is signalled by a green light on the trailer)}
  
  \procedureItem{DACS1}{Wait until the system is in a stable state. The power interruption will cause all valves to return to their normal state and the system will automatically depressurize. Reaching the stable state can be confirmed visually as well as acoustically.}
  
  \procedureItem{TC}{Safe state assurance}
