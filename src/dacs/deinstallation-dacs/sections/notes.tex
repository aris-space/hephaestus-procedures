    Important files that might have to be changed:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{/home/dacs/git/configuration-tests/PRO\_DACS-Configuration.xlsx}
            \\
            here you can change controllable actuators per phase and sensor abort thresholds, afterwards do \texttt{catkin build} again

      \item \textbf{/home/dacs/git/user-interface/rosWebPage/ui/configure\_ui.py}
            \\
            here you can change anything related to the UI, in particular which config file is used (this is quite unreadable code so use CTRL-F to find things)
            To apply changes run:
            \\
            \texttt{cd /home/dacs/git/user-interface/rosWebPage/ui/}
            \\
            \texttt{python3 configure\_ui.py}

      \item \textbf{/home/dacs/git/software-rpi4/state\_machine/src/:}
            \\
            In this folder you find the state machine list (list of phases) and sequences (watch out for the syntax if you change anything here)
            Check which file is used in state\_machine.cpp
            afterwards do \texttt{catkin build} again

      \item \textbf{/home/dacs/git/software-rpi4/data\_acquisition/src/core/T7\_streaming.py}
            \\
            here you can change the streaming rate in case you get a Labjack buffer error or anything of that kind

      \item \textbf{/home/dacs/git/software-rpi4/data\_acquisition/launch/test.launch}
            \\
            here you can change which ROS modules are started at roslaunch, might be useful to delete the throttling module if it gives any errors for example

      \item \textbf{/home/dacs/git/software-rpi4/throttling\_control/src}
            \\
            In the \texttt{setpoint.py}, \texttt{control.py} and the core folder you can change the setting for the setpoints and the controller parameters.

    \end{itemize}
